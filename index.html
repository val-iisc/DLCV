      <h2>Brief description of the course</h2>

      <div class="entry">

<p>In the recent years, Deep Learning has pushed to boundaries of research in many fields. This course focuses on the application of Deep Learning in the field of Computer Vision. The first half of the course formulates the basics of Deep Learning, which are built on top of various concepts from Image Processing and Machine Learning.  The second half highlights the various flavors of Deep Learning in Computer Vision, including Generative Models (VAE, GANs, Diffusion Models, Flow Matching), 3D reconstruction (NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting etc), Recurrent Models, and Deep Reinforcement Learning Models, as well as foundational models such as Stable Diffusion.
